# 🛡️ Phishing Detection using Machine Learning

A machine learning project that detects phishing attempts using features extracted from real-world phishing data. This project combines **network security fundamentals** with **data-driven intelligence** to enhance online safety.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Phishing attacks are one of the most common forms of cyber threats targeting users via email, websites, or messaging platforms. This project aims to develop a supervised machine learning model that can accurately classify URLs/emails as **phishing** or **legitimate**, helping reduce the risk of such attacks.
